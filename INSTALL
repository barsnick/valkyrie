Introduction
============

Valkyrie is a Qt4 application and uses qmake as part of the build
process.  qmake is part of your Qt4 installation.  You should check
that you have the correct qmake version, by running "qmake --version",
because in some cases the installed "qmake" is actually a Qt3 version.
It may be that the version you need is installed as "qmake-qt4".

If you want to play around with the build config, check out:
valyrie.pro    - main qmake project file
src/src.pro    - the meat of the project
vk_config.pri  - project include file: included everywere

In particular, you may want to edit the following:
- src/src.pro:
  SOURCES += /usr/share/qtcreator/gdbmacros/gdbmacros.cpp

  Note: Qt wants this in order to create lots of debug info. If you're
  not debugging, then you probably don't want this. Is also rather
  nasty to hardcode the path in like this, but I don't know of a good
  workaround...

- vk_config.pri:
  CONFIG           += silent      # make --quiet
  CONFIG           += debug       # release/debug



Build and run without "installing"
==================================

qmake   # or qmake-qt4, see comments above
make

The valkyrie binary is put here: ./bin/valkyrie
make clean to clean up and start again
make distclean to also remove all the Makefiles created by qmake.



Build and install
=================

qmake PREFIX=/path/to/installation/tree
make
make install


That's it!
